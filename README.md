### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matheus, and I've been working as a Full Stack developer, primarily in the PHP and JavaScript ecosystems.
I have experience maintaining **monolithic systems** in PHP, implementing **process automation**, and integrating **frontend and backend features** with a focus on testing and continuous improvement.

My tech stack includes **PHP**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Bootstrap**, **TailwindCSS**, and **MySQL**, along with tools like **Git**, **GitHub**, **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and **Unit Testing**.

When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m learning new technologies, solving complex problems, and contributing to impactful projects.
